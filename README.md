   - Configure your Git username and email:
```
 git config --global user.name "Kau-Molepo"
``` 
```
 git config --global user.email "me@gmail.com"
```
   - Security Confirmation between github and local machine
- Create a New Repository on GitHub

   ![alt text](image-4.png)
   - New Repository created: Repository name "PLP_Software_Engineering" and its visibility is set to public.
- Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub
   - In Git Bash, navigate to the directory where you want to create your local repository:
      - cd ---> Change directory (must pass the landing directory) 
      ```
        cd B:\PLP\PLP_Software_Engineering\se-assignment-1-setting-up-your-developer-environment-Kau-Molepo
      ```
   - Initialize a new Git repository:
      ```
        git init
      ```
   - Add your new GitHub repository as a remote:
      ```
        git remote add origin https://github.com/Kau-Molepo/PLP_Software_Engineering.git
      ```
   - Security Confirmation between github and local machine
- Add Files and Commit
   -  Create a new file in your repository:
      ```
        echo "This is a read me file as a first file created in Git bash VIM IDE running in CLI mode" > README.md
        #Use nano filename.extention to open an editor for file in editing mode 
      ```
      ```
        echo "Python file for functinalty testing" > Hello.py
        #Use nano filename.extention to open an editor for file in editing mode 
      ```
   - Add the file to the staging area:
      ```
        git add .  #'.' is used to add all files
      ```
   - Commit the file to your repository:
       ```
        git commit -m "This the first commit(created a readme and a python file)"
      ```
- Push to GitHub
   - Push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub:
      ```
        git push -u origin master
      ```
   - check the status of repository:
      ```
        git status
      ```

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

- Python Installation: I downloaded and installed the latest Python version from the official website, ensuring it was added to my system's PATH.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

- Pip was installed automatically with Python. I used it to install project-specific packages as needed:
   ```
      pip install <package_name>
   ```
- python libraries installed(Djanko, Flask, Scikit, Numpy, Pandas ...)

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

- MySQL Community Server: I downloaded and installed the MySQL Community Server from the official website.
- MySQL Workbench: I installed MySQL Workbench for database management and administration.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

- Docker: I downloaded and installed Docker from the official website.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

- I personalized the appearance and behavior through VS Code's settings.
- I installed the following extensions to enhance my workflow:
   - Python: Provides essential Python language support.
   - GitLens: Integrates Git seamlessly into VS Code.
   - Prettier: Auto-formats code for improved readability.
